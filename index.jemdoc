== BIOGRAPHY

I am a recent-graduated Master student looking for PhD opportunities. \n 
My research interest is *machine learning*, *robotic creativity*, *computer vision* and *motion data processing*. \n
More specifically, I am interested in developing an *auto choreography model* that is able to generate novel motion(dance moves) that greatly expresses the audio input(given music), after being trained with the videos of skilful and prestigious dancers.\n
